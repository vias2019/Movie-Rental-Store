# Movie-Rental-Store

After unzipping, compile & run in the same folder you've unzipped the files to.
Data files should remain in the same folder as the source files & executable.
From the folder with all the files, the following commands would work:
> g++ -o movie-rental-store *.cpp
> ./movie-rental-store
